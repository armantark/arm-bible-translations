# No Armenian Copy

Claude cannot produce correct Armenian. Follow these rules strictly:

- **Never write, modify, or translate Armenian or Classical Armenian text.** This includes both Western Armenian (armenian.ts) and Grabar (classical.ts).
- **Never delete or overwrite existing Armenian text** in these files, even accidentally (e.g. via a full-file rewrite).
- When adding new locale keys, use **English placeholder strings** with a `// TODO: translate` comment.
- If you need to restore corrupted Armenian text, use `git checkout` to recover from version control.
- Armenian translations must be provided by the user or by Gemini. Do not attempt them without explicit user approval.

```typescript
// GOOD - English placeholder with TODO
confirmDelete: 'Are you sure?',  // TODO: translate

// BAD - Attempting Armenian
confirmDelete: 'Համozna...',
```
